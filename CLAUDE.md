# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal React/JSX project containing only a single `main.jsx` file. The file is currently empty, indicating this may be a new or experimental project setup.

## Development Commands

No build tools, package managers, or configuration files are currently present in this repository. Standard JavaScript/React development commands would need to be set up if this project is intended to grow beyond a single file.

## Architecture

Currently minimal - consists of a single empty JSX file with no established patterns or architecture to follow.

## Feature Implementation Process

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any feature, you MUST follow this strict process:

1. **Present Implementation Plan**: 
   - Create a detailed implementation plan outlining the approach
   - Briefly explain why this approach was chosen over alternatives
   - Wait for user approval before proceeding

2. **After Plan Approval**, ask the user to choose between:
   - **"Step by Step Mode"**: Implement each step individually and wait for user confirmation after each step
   - **"Bulk Mode"**: Implement all steps sequentially without stopping for confirmation

This ensures transparency and gives the user control over the implementation process!
